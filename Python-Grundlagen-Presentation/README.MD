# Intro

This is a simple presentation i did for introducing new students to python.
It is by no means finished, but it should contain *some* useful information about the absolute basics and
also about modules, packages and how to install linux from source, for students using macOS or other
Unix like systems.

To start the presentation, just open the index.html file in your web-browser of choice.

## Contribution

There currently is no way to contribute, because this is just an export of a markdown file written in
[Obsidian.MD](obsidian.md).

If for some reason you still want to contribute, I may reconsider in the future, if there are actual requests
for it...
